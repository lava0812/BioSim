### The project

We got introduced to an island called Rossum√∏ya consisting of two species; herbivores and carnivores.
The goal was to create a simulation of the island with an annual cycle consisting of migration, aging
, weight loss, eating/hunting and reproducing. Our main goal is to simulate the cycle with python.

#### Achievement
We have learned a lot during this january block. This project has taught us how to work in teams, 
and how to work under a structured plan.

Our main goal was to make the best possible simulation of the island, and we think we have
learned a lot more on our way to the main goal. 

#### Improvements
* Better optimization
