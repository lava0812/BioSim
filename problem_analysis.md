#Problem analysis - A41 Sathuriyan Lavanyan 

##Key questions 
### - What are the key components of the "world" to simulate?
We will mainly have 5 files that we will be working with. These are animals.py, landscape.py, island.py, 
visualization.py and simulation.py. Each file will build upon classes. 
###Landscape
This part of the script will provide us with information about the landscape; how they function and how the interaction 
is between one another

    - Superclass Landscape that contains common characteristics of the different environment.
    - Four subclasses (Highland, Lowland, Desert and Water)
    - Implement the Annual Cycle on Rossum√∏ya
