contain the root `toctree` directive.

The project
-----------
We got introduced to a island called Rossum√∏ya consisting of two species; herbivores and carnivores.
The goal was to create a simulation of the island with a annual cycle consisting of migration, aging,
weight loss, and eating/hunting.

Achievement
-----------
We have learned a lot during this january block. This project has taught us how to work in teams,
and how to work under a structured plan.

Our main goal was to make the best possible simulation of the island, and we think we have
learned a lot more on our way to the main goal.

Improvements
------------
* Better optimization
* Better use of Sphinx
* Using decorators better

For future developers
---------------------
* __slot__ is used to make the script faster. Further developers should note that changes made to
the variables and variable names should be added to the _slot_.

so to the future developers you must use the
right variables
